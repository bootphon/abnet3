# ABnet3

Representation learning package using side information, system for subword modeling for [Zeroresource challenge](http://sapience.dec.ens.fr/bootphon/2017/index.html).

### Overview

<!-- **Sense of Place** is a feeling or perception held by people about a location: some characteristics of a place can
be perceived at first sight, such as wealth or safety. Lately, there has been recent interest in predicting these
human judgments with computer vision techniques [Ordonez and Berg 2014].

The **CNN architecture with the NetVLAD** layer from [ArandjeloviÄ‡ et al. 2016] significantly outperforms
non-learnt image representations as well as off-the-shelf CNN descriptors, and improves over the state-of-the-
art on challenging image retrieval benchmarks. The goal of this project is to transfer the CNN representation
learnt for Visual Place Recognition to predict human judgments of safety and wealth of locations. -->

Build Representation for speech frames based on side information. Composed of different modules :

* `model.py`
* `loss.py`
* `sampler.py`
* `trainer.py`
* `embedder.py`
* `utils.py`
* `features.py`

### Installation of the package

#### Using conda

To install the ABnet3 package, you can use Anaconda, and either create a conda environment:

    conda env create --name abnet3 python=3.6 -f environment.yml

or use a conda environment you already have with python 3 :
    conda env update -f environment.yml

To install with GPU support (replace cuda75 with your version of cuda)

    conda install  pytorch=0.2 cuda75 -c pytorch

#### Using pip

- install the version 0.2.0 of pytorch for your hardware (http://pytorch.org/previous-versions/)

- install the pip packages : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Once all the necessary packages are installed, simply launch:

#### Run abnet3 installation

    python setup.py build && python setup.py install

If you want to work on ABnet3 and develop your own modules, instead of:

    python setup.py install

you can launch:

    python setup.py develop

### Tensorboard vizualisation

The package tensorboardX needs to be installed to train the model: `pip install tensorboardX`.

The package will save train / dev loss during training. To vizualise them :

- Install tensorboard (`conda install tensorflow tensorflow-tensorboard`)

- run `tensorboard --logdir path/to/logdir`.
The default logdir is `./run` in the current directory.

### Documentation

You can see examples for running the gridsearch and replicating our results
in the repository https://github.com/Rachine/sampling_siamese2018

The cli documentation is here https://coml.lscp.ens.fr/git/Rachine/abnet3/src/master/gridsearch.md

### Tests

The package comes with a unit-tests suit. To run it, first install *pytest* on your Python environment:

    pip install pytest
    pytest test/
