# ABnet3

Representation learning package using side information, system for subword modeling for [Zeroresource challenge]().

### Overview

<!-- **Sense of Place** is a feeling or perception held by people about a location: some characteristics of a place can
be perceived at first sight, such as wealth or safety. Lately, there has been recent interest in predicting these
human judgments with computer vision techniques [Ordonez and Berg 2014].

The **CNN architecture with the NetVLAD** layer from [ArandjeloviÄ‡ et al. 2016] significantly outperforms
non-learnt image representations as well as off-the-shelf CNN descriptors, and improves over the state-of-the-
art on challenging image retrieval benchmarks. The goal of this project is to transfer the CNN representation
learnt for Visual Place Recognition to predict human judgments of safety and wealth of locations. -->

### Installation of the package
